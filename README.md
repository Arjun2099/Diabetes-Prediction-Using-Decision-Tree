# Diabetes Prediction Using Decision Tree 
## Introduction 
Decision tree is the most powerful and popular tool for 
classification and prediction. A Decision tree is a flowchart like 
tree structure, where each internal node denotes a test on an 
attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and 
each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label. 

In this project we build a decsion tree to predict diabetes for
Pima Indians dataset with variables such as age, blood, pressure etc


## Major Steps
1. Load the required libraries
2. Load the data sets using Pandas 
3. Divide the columns to  two types of variables dependent and independent variables
4. Bulding Decision Tree using scikit-learn
5. Evaluvating the model or classifier 
6. Creating a visual Decision Tree
